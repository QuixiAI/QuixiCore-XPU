# Agent Instructions

This is the QuixiCore XPU backend. Kernel work must be correctness-first,
measurement-driven, and recorded in the performance notebook.
<!-- qx:shared:end header -->

<!-- qx:shared:begin read-first v1 -->
## Read First

- User-facing overview: `README.md`.
- Repository layout: `docs/repository-structure.md`.
- Performance operating guide: `perf/perf.md`.
- Established findings: `perf/findings.md` — read before proposing any
  experiment; do not re-derive or retry anything listed there without new
  evidence.
- Idea backlog: `perf/backlog.md` — pick the next experiment from here; update
  it when you finish one.
- Optimization notebook: `perf/optimization_status.md`.
- Baseline index: `perf/baseline_status.md`.
- Kernel metadata: `.quixicore/kernels.yaml` and
  `.quixicore/quant-formats.yaml`.

## The Two Gates

No change is a candidate unless it passes both gates in `perf/perf.md`: the
fp64-oracle ctest suite and torch.xpu parity. A speedup that regresses either
gate is not a win.
<!-- qx:backend:end backend-notes -->

<!-- qx:shared:begin perf-gate v1 -->
## Performance Optimization Requirement

Before committing any kernel implementation, kernel routing change, benchmark
change, or performance claim, the agent must complete at least one focused
performance optimization run on an affected kernel.

A valid run includes:

- The kernel, public route, dtype/format, and shape set.
- Correctness for the touched path.
- Baseline/current timing and candidate timing when testing a variant.
- Intel GPU target, oneAPI compiler, SYCL backend/runtime, Level Zero driver
  when available, command line, warmups, iterations, median, and variance or
  min/max.
- A keep/reject decision in `perf/optimization_status.md`.

If a suitable Intel GPU/SYCL runtime is unavailable, do not commit a kernel
optimization or speedup claim. Stop and report the blocker, or restrict the
commit to docs/scaffolding with no performance claim.

Pure documentation and metadata-only commits may skip the kernel perf run, but
they must not claim a performance improvement.
<!-- qx:shared:end perf-gate -->

<!-- qx:shared:begin evidence-rules v1 -->
## Evidence Rules

- A run that times out or crashes is INCONCLUSIVE — never a rejection and never
  a win. Record it as INCONCLUSIVE with the timeout or failure mode.
- Only completed runs count as measurements. Never extrapolate from partial
  iterations or a killed benchmark.
- Report median plus variance or min/max from the stated warmup/iteration
  counts. If the baseline and candidate ranges overlap, there is no claim —
  rerun with more iterations or record INCONCLUSIVE.
- Never compare numbers taken on different hosts, drivers, or toolchains
  without saying so in the same sentence.
- Notebook verdict vocabulary: LANDED, KEPT, REJECTED, CANDIDATE, DEFERRED,
  INCONCLUSIVE, MIXED, RECORDED.

<!-- qx:shared:begin how-to-optimize v1 -->
## How To Optimize

- Start from `perf/perf.md`; form a bottleneck hypothesis before editing.
- Change one meaningful factor at a time: work-group shape, subgroup count,
  memory layout, local-memory staging, fusion, dequant strategy, routing
  threshold, or specialization.
- Compare against oneDNN, Triton XPU, framework paths, naive decompositions, and
  current XPU kernels where relevant.
- Keep only wins that pass correctness, improve realistic priority shapes, and
  do not regress supported edge shapes or tolerances.
- Store raw output under `perf/results/`; copy durable conclusions into
  `perf/optimization_status.md`. Do not commit large profiler traces.
<!-- qx:shared:end how-to-optimize -->

<!-- qx:shared:begin idea-selection v1 -->
## Idea Selection (The Beam)

- Keep `perf/backlog.md` to 3-5 active idea families, best first. Each family
  carries a parent result, hypothesis, evidence so far, next action, and kill
  criteria.
- Pick the next experiment from the top of the beam unless the user directs
  otherwise. Do not run a single-incumbent hill climb on one idea.
- Do not kill a family on one failed singleton. If two ideas are individually
  neutral but touch independent costs, try the combination before retiring
  either.
- When an experiment concludes, update the beam (advance or kill) and promote
  durable conclusions to `perf/findings.md`. When a kill criterion fires,
  record the kill and its reason in `perf/findings.md` so it is never retried.
- New ideas that surface mid-run go to the backlog, not into scope creep.

<!-- qx:shared:begin useful-commands v1 -->
## Useful Commands

```bash
cmake --preset dev
cmake --build --preset dev
ctest --preset dev
python3 perf/bench_kernels.py --phase all --preset dev
python3 perf/bench_kernels.py --phase all --preset sycl
```

Use SYCL event profiling, Level Zero tooling, VTune, or oneAPI tools when timing
does not explain a bottleneck. Record the trace path and conclusion, not the
full trace.
<!-- qx:shared:end useful-commands -->

<!-- qx:shared:begin escalation v1 -->
## Escalation Protocol

- Stop and report to the user instead of improvising when required
  hardware/runtime is unavailable, when branch or upstream state is ambiguous,
  or when a correctness gate and a perf result conflict.
- Use subagents for bulk reading (notebooks over ~1,000 lines), broad reference
  searches, and multi-config sweeps. Subagents report numbers with full
  provenance; the primary agent writes the notebook entry.
- After two consecutive INCONCLUSIVE runs on one hypothesis, stop and present
  the data rather than rerunning a third time.
- When stuck (repeated rejects or sub-bar wins), re-read `perf/findings.md`,
  profile before guessing again, and prefer one structural change from a
  different beam family over another parameter retune.
<!-- qx:shared:end escalation -->

<!-- qx:shared:begin git-policy v1 -->
## Git Publishing Policy

- Never create, switch, rename, or choose a branch unless the user explicitly
  requests it. The user owns branch selection.
- Never create a pull request unless the user explicitly requests one.
- When asked to "commit and push," commit on the branch that is already checked
  out and push that same branch to its configured upstream.
- If the current branch has no upstream, pushing it is blocked, or branch
  selection is ambiguous, stop and ask the user rather than creating or
  switching branches or opening a pull request.
<!-- qx:shared:end git-policy -->

<!-- qx:shared:begin build-policy v1 -->
## Build Artifact Policy

- Keep generated build artifacts under one repository-local `build/` root, with
  incompatible configurations isolated as `build/<profile>/`.
- Do not create top-level task-, agent-, experiment-, or architecture-named
  build directories.
- Add a reusable preset or wrapper for a lasting configuration; use
  `build/scratch/` for a temporary experiment and remove it afterward.
- Build trees are disposable. Never treat one as durable correctness or
  performance evidence; record evidence under the documented `perf/` paths.
<!-- qx:shared:end build-policy -->

<!-- qx:shared:begin notebook-discipline v1 -->
## Notebook Discipline

- `perf/optimization_status.md` is append-only and ordered oldest-first. Never
  rewrite or reorder existing entries.
- New entry headings use the format `## YYYY-MM-DD: <kernel or pass> — VERDICT`
  with a verdict from the Evidence Rules vocabulary.
- After appending an entry, regenerate the index:
  `python3 ../tools/perf_notebook.py index perf/optimization_status.md`
  (run from this repository root; adjust the path if the umbrella checkout is
  a sibling rather than the parent directory).
- Distilled truths go to `perf/findings.md`; queued ideas go to
  `perf/backlog.md`; the notebook holds the full evidence.
<!-- qx:shared:end notebook-discipline -->

<!-- qx:shared:begin hygiene v1 -->
## Engineering Hygiene

- Check `git status` before editing. Do not revert user changes.
- Keep backend-local optimizations behind the public QuixiCore contract.
- Update metadata, tests, docs, and bindings when changing public behavior.
- Do not import reference implementation code unless licensing and provenance
  have been reviewed.
- Keep commits scoped and descriptive.
